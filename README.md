# Open Source Computer Science Courses from Top Universities in the US.
A collection of open-source, free courses from top universities in the United States offered on YouTube to serve as a comprehensive computer science degree.

# Summary
The purpose of this is to serve as a meticulously curated list of open-source and accessible high quality courses in computer science, with lectures available on YouTube from world-renowned institutions such as MIT, Harvard, Stanford, and UC Berkeley. This repository is not aimed to provide the resources of a full course (although many of these courses are offered for free through Coursera and EdX on [Open Source Society University](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/tree/master)); it is a thorough, comprehensive exploration of everything from computer science fundamentals and principles to advanced topics designed for those who aspire to gain a deep and holistic understanding of the field for free, at their own pace on YouTube.

### Curriculum Structure:

- **Introductory Computer Science:** This section is for learners new to the field, offering a taste of what computer science entails.
- **Core Computer Science:** This comprehensive segment covers the essentials, paralleling the first three years of a typical computer science undergraduate program.
- **Advanced Computer Science:** Reflecting the senior year of a computer science degree, this section offers advanced courses for learners to specialize in areas of interest.

### Duration and Pace:
While self-paced, the program is designed to be completed in approximately two years with a commitment of around 20 hours per week. Learners can track their progress using [this spreadsheet](url), adapting their study schedule to personal commitments.

### Cost:
The core material, sourced from YouTube lectures, is entirely free. Some courses may recommend textbooks or supplementary materials which may incur costs, but these are optional. The community is encouraged to also open PRs with open-source or freely available textbooks, but EbookFoundation also has a great selection of resources [here](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books) if that is your preferred learning style. 

### Contributing to this Project:
The repository welcomes contributions from its community. Whether itâ€™s suggesting additional resources, helping to refine existing content, or offering peer support, every contribution enriches the learning experience for all.

# Curriculum
While the curriculum is designed to be done in order, you can model your learning based on your current educational background. Although I would still recommend starting from the beginning; the refreshers from these courses can't hurt.
